### Hello! I am an aquatic biogeochemist and ecosystem ecologist.

I am interested in the biogeochemistry and ecosystem function of aquatic systems in response to environmental change. I am currently a [Modelscape](https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP/overview) Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Blaszczak Lab](https://blaszczaklab.weebly.com/) in the Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Science at the University of Nevada, Reno as well as a Visiting Scholar in the [Bernhardt Lab](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/bernhardt) in the Department of Biology at Duke University. 

Links pertaining to recent workshops and publications are pinned below. To learn more about my research, please visit [my website](https://www.heililowman.com/research.html).
